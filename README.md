## Getting started & development 

### Fork and clone this repository
The **vision of this theme** is **simplicity and accessibility**, to easily create stunning websites from scratch.  
Therefore, it's not available as a classic gem-based Jekyll theme, but as a ready-to-use GitHub repository that you just need to fork and clone.  
So, get ahead and make a fork of this repository, rename it if you like to suit the name of the site you want to create, locally clone it, and directly start editing!

Alternatively, you can just [download the theme as a zip file](https://oneflow-jekyll-theme.github.io/theme-download/oneflow-jekyll-theme.zip) to immediately get started.

### How to start a development docker container
To test your website and see all of your changes in real-time without deploying it online, you can easily build your site locally.  
- Make sure you have [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.  
- Open up a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run ```docker compose up```.

Your site will then be visible at ```http://0.0.0.0:4000/``` in any browser.
